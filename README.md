# Birmingham Housing Price Predictor
Machine Learning Project 4

## Background 

Based on data gathered from the UK's Government Website, the Department for Levelling Up, Housing & Communities API, The Transport for West Midlands API, and The Police API. We want to create a Machine Learning Model that is able to predict House Prices in the city of Birmingham, UK based on certain features. Like crime rate, housing features, schools around the area, and access to transportation.
